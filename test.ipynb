      "3. **Chilies**: Fresh or dried chilies like bird's eye chilies, Thai chilies, or jalapeños add heat to the curry. You can adjust the level of spiciness to your liking.\n",
      "4. **Onions**: Thinly sliced or diced onions sautéed with garlic and ginger form the base of the curry.\n",
      "5. **Ginger**: Fresh or ground ginger adds warmth and depth to the curry.\n",
      "6. **Garlic**: Like onions, garlic is sautéed with ginger to create a flavorful foundation for the curry.\n",
      "7. **Protein**: You can use various proteins like chicken, beef, pork, shrimp, tofu, or vegetables (like bell peppers, bamboo shoots, or Thai basil) as the main ingredient.\n",
      "8. **Fish Sauce**: A small amount of fish sauce adds umami flavor and salty depth to the curry.\n",
      "9. **Lime Juice**: Freshly squeezed lime juice adds brightness and acidity to balance out the richness of the coconut milk.\n",
      "10. **Thai Basil**: Chopped Thai basil leaves add a pop of freshness and fragrance to the dish.\n",
