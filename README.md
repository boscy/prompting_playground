# prompting_playground

A playground repository for experimenting with prompt engineering, LLM interactions, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines using LangChain and local models.

## Overview

This repository provides a hands-on environment for exploring:
- **Prompt Engineering**: Crafting effective prompts for language models
- **LangChain Integration**: Working with LangChain's prompt templates and chains
- **RAG Pipelines**: Building retrieval-augmented generation systems
- **Local LLM Usage**: Running models locally with Ollama (llama3)
- **Vector Storage**: Using ChromaDB for document embeddings

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) installed and running
- The `llama3` model pulled in Ollama
